        <h3>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the wheel</h3>
        <p>The impact of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been clear to see at Manchester United.

An excellent start under the Norwegian coach have seen spirits revitalised at Old Trafford as United keep their hopes of top-four football alive.
And now supporters have been airing a new chant to document feeling good factor since Solskjaer took over at the club.
Although the song began to first circulate earlier in the season when Jose Mourinho was in charge, the new chant has gained a new cult following after it was adapted to praise Solskjaer.
The original chant first gathered mass popularity when it was chanted by joyous fans following the incredible Champions League victory away against Juventus last year.
However, while the new version of the fan chant still pays tribute to Mourinho signings Alexis Sanchez, Paul Pogba and Fred. There is also lines which declare a love for Marcus Rashford and the new manager in charge of the club.

          <h3>Pogba recovering from his injury</h3>
          <p>Manchester United are in a rut and Paul Pogba has been out injured.
The French midfielder is doing everything he can to be fit for slumping United after the international break.
Pogba, 26, has only played in once Premier League game since Aug. 31 and has recently aggravated a foot problem after briefly returning to action in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal.
He has missed five of Unitedâ€™s last seven games in all competitions and was pictured wearing a cast on his right foot.
United posted images on social media on Tuesday of Pogba in Dubai on a warm weather trip to work on his fitness and try to be ready for their huge Premier League clash against Liverpool on Oct. 20
Pogba will spend most of this week at the Transform Altitude Performance Center in order to accelerate his recovery from injury.

        <h3>Rashford not happy about results</h3>
        <p>Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has said he didn't think Liverpool "were good enough" to deserve a point following their 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday.
Rashford, 21, opened the scoring with his fourth goal of the season, and substitute Adam Lallana equalised for Liverpool in the 85th minute after the visitors enjoyed a much-improved second half.
United's frontman spoke to Sky Sports (h/t Goal) after full time and said: "We deserved the three points. I don't think they were good enough to get a draw out of the game or a win but this is football. It was a big opportunity missed and we just fell short. Hopefully in midweek we can get a win and it will start a run for us."
Sunday's result was United's sixth in a row without a win (in 90 minutes), though Rashford sensed the positives to take from a point against the Premier League leaders.

          <h3>Fred will take Paul's position for a while and he's been brilliant for United</h3>
          <p>Ole Gunnar Solskajaer has challenged Fred to step up and fill the gap left by Paul Pogba at Manchester United while the Frenchman recovers from injury.
The United boss confirmed after Sunday's win at Norwich that Pogba is set to be out until December after missing eight of the last 10 games with an ankle problem.
Fred has started four of the five matches since Pogba last played against Arsenal a month ago, and has at last shown signs of improvement after a difficult start at United.
'There is no use talking about who is not going to be here for a long, long time, because he is not going to come on the pitch and help us until he is fit,' said the United manager.
